BEGIN
    Loop Through Each Character of the Sentence:

    For each character in the sentence:
    Increment sentenceLength by 1.
    If the character is a vowel (i.e., it exists in the defined vowels list), increment vowelsCount.
    If the character is a space and the next character is not a space (and itâ€™s not the last character of the sentence), increment wordCount.
    After the Loop:

    Since words are separated by spaces, add 1 to wordCounter to account for the last word (if the sentence is not empty).
    Return or Output the Results:

    Return the values of sentenceLength, wordCount, and vowelsCount.
