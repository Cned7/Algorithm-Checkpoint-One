Algorithm:
Initialize Counters:

Set sentenceLength to 0.
Set wordCount to 0.
Set vowelsCount to 0.
Define Vowels: "aeiou"

Loop Through Each Character of the Sentence:

For each character in the sentence:
Increment lengthCounter by 1.
If the character is a vowel (i.e., it exists in the defined vowels list), increment vowelCounter.
If the character is a space and the next character is not a space (and itâ€™s not the last character of the sentence), increment wordCounter.
After the Loop:

Since words are separated by spaces, add 1 to wordCounter to account for the last word (if the sentence is not empty).
Return or Output the Results:

Return the values of lengthCounter, wordCounter, and vowelCounter.
